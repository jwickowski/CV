# Jerzy Wickowski / CV

Senior Full-stack Engineer with 15 years of experience. I can help you with legacy systems to reduce their cost of maintaining and allow them to
grow, by introducing: CleanCode, automated tests, better architecture, CI / CD pipelines, and by improving team cooperation.

I deeply believe:

> Creating software is not only writing a code, but mainly solving client's issues or helping him in the realization of his idea.
